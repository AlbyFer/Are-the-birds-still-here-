Environmental Impact Assessment for Windfarm

Assessing the volume change and geographical disposition of a bird population after the construction of an offshore windfarm, namely 
Nysted I and II. 

Modelling was carried out using a CReSS based GAM, fitted with the SALSA2D algorithm. Model diagnostic is later carried out to check for
assumptions. A GEE was subsequently required, given the non-independence of residuals.
